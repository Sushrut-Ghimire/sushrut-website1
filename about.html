            <br>
            <p>In an attempt to gather knowledge throughout my life, i love to explore. However, in my case, the exploration is limited to whatever books i can get my hands on, whatever vlogs available on the internet and whatever tutorials uploaded on YouTube as i am not rich enough to transcend physical borders. Still, this limitation hasn't stopped me from believing in the process of learning. As of now, i consider myself a student of science, mainly physics and mathematics. I do love literary works and have written a few articles and also published a book, so that technically makes me an author as well. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As you can guess from this website, and the other one i've provided the link of, i am also a pretty decent Front End Web Developer and I will work for reasonable people at a reasonable price.

            <p>In the near future, I plan to pursue physics as my academic and career choice. Currently, i am invested in writing a paper on Thorium based Small Modular Reactors and wish to complete and publish the paper roughly around the end of my undergraduate years. So, any help on this topic will greatly be appreciated.</p>
